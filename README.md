- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing
- RESTful API endpoints for user management
- Swagger UI integration for API documentation

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- PostgreSQL (for database)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Swagger (for API documentation)

## Getting Started

To get started with Auth Guard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/imhosseinzadeh/auth-guard.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd auth-guard`
3. Install dependencies: `./gradlew build`
4. Configure the application (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to configure the following:

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can:

- Register new users via the registration endpoint
- Log in with registered user credentials to obtain JWT tokens
- Use the JWT tokens for accessing protected API endpoints
- Define policies for controlling access to resources based on user attributes and context
